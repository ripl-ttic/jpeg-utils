        decompression with in-memory buffers.

    <description>
        note: This is a simple enough library that you could just copy the .c
        and .h files in to your own programs.

        To use the library, link against -ljpeg-utils, or use 
        pkg-config --cflags --libs jpeg-utils

    <requirements>
        libjpeg62

        For faster performance, install libjpeg-turbo, an SSE-accelerated
        library that is ABI compatible with libjpeg62.
